# Sample Backup Definition File
# Defines a set of volumes to be created in balenaOS 
# For each volume supply a content definition consisting of a set of:
#  - source - the file / directory to backup
#  - target - target file / directory in volume 
#    If no filter is given, source will be mapped under this name in the volume directory
#    If a filter is given and source is a directory, a directory under this name is created in 
#    the volume and the filtered content are mapped into that directory.
#    If target is left away source is mapped to volume-name. This only makes sense for one source 
#    per volume.
#  - filter - filter sources by regex
#    If filter expression is a valid regular exxpression and source is a directory
#    all files in source that match the filter expression are mapped to the volume / target directory.
