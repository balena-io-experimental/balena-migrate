# Balena migrate example config file
# copy to /etc/balena-migrate.conf
# see README.md for instructions

# Path to a resin image to install to the device
# example: IMAGE_NAME=resin-image-genericx86-64.resinos-2.26.0+rev1-dev-v8.0.0.img.gz
# this variable MUST be set
IMAGE_NAME=

# A backup script. Will be invoked by balena-migrate with <scriptname> backup.tgz
# Top level folders in this archive will be created as volumes (<APPID>_foldername)
# if the are referenced from application containers
# example: BACKUP_SCRIPT=sample-backup.sh

# If no back script is given the variable BACKUP_DEFINITION is tested.
# If it is set and points to a file a backup will be created as defined
# in the backup definition file.
# Please refer to sample-backup.yml as reference / sample
# WARNING: This feature is work in progress and not yet likely to work
# example BACKUP_DEFINITION="backup-def.yml"

# Supply a balena config file (config.json). Default is to use the file provided
# in the OS image
# example: BALENA_CONFIG=config.json

# Wifi config migration settings

# This setting protects WIFI settings existing in the image. If you have configured
# a wifi during image creation and want to migrate further wifis defined on the
# device set HAS_WIFI_CFG to TRUE

# Set to TRUE to migrate all wifis (wpa or network manager definitions) found on
# the device
MIGRATE_ALL_WIFIS=TRUE

# Set to the name of a file in HOME_DIR that contains a list of wifi networks to
# migrate, one per line
# example: MIGRATE_WIFI_CFG="migrate-wifis"

# Set to TRUE to create a netwok manager file for the WIFI defined in the balena
# config file (config.json) supplied. 
# !!This option needs https://stedolan.github.io/jq/ to be installed on the device!!
# example: BALENA_WIFI=TRUE 

# Add NetworkManager files
# copy a network manager file
# example: COPY_NMGR_FILES="eth0_static enp2s0_static enp3s0_static"

# Do not require NetworkManager files
# When no wifi connections are configured and a default ethernet will be used, 
# the system can migrated without a networkmanager config file. 
# By default the migrator will check for the existance of a network manager configuration 
# and fail if none is found. 
# Setting REQUIRE_NMGR_FILE to FALSE disables that test.
# example: REQUIRE_NMGR_FILE=FALSE

# X86 / grub settings
# These settings are only relevant for X86 devices using grub as boot manager

# Install grub. Recent images (as of 2.26.0) contain a grub setup and do not need
# a separate grub installation.
# If specifying this flag please also specify valid values for 
# GRUB_BOOT_IMG, GRUB_CORE_IMG, GRUB_CFG

# example: GRUB_INSTALL=TRUE

# grub config file to install. Only used if GRUB_INSTALL is set to TRUE
# example: GRUB_CFG=grub.cfg_internal-2.26.0+rev1

# grub boot & core images extracted from flasher image (see extract.sh docs).
# Only used if GRUB_INSTALL is set to TRUE
# example: 
# GRUB_BOOT_IMG=boot.img
# GRUB_CORE_IMG=core.img

# Scan drive for bad blocks
# use the badblocks utility to scan root device for bad blocks. 
# Warning: this operation can take anything from several minutes to several hours 
# example: fail if any bad blocks are found
# MAX_BADBLOCKS=0

# Scan drive for bad blocks
# use the badblocks utility to scan root device for bad blocks. 
# Warning: this operation can take anything from one to several hours 
# example: to expect at least 200KB / sec write speed
# MIN_WRITE_SPEED=200

# DEBUG Options

# Set to TRUE to create an initramfs log in /run/initramfs/initramfs.debug
# example: DEBUG=TRUE

# Test mode, prevents initramfs from actually flashing the image
# example: NO_FLASH=TRUE 

# Test mode, prevents balena-migrate from modifying the boot configuration
# example: NO_SETUP=TRUE

# Boot system automatically after balena-migrate has succeed
# Specifies the intervakl in seconds after which to boot
# example reboot 10 secods aftermigrate script has finished
# DO_REBOOT=10

# Provide a separate drive for a detailed log of the migration procedure
# must be a separate drive from the boot drive, eg. a USB stick or a separate
# hard drive
# example:
# LOG_DRIVE=/dev/sdb1
# FS type of LOG_DRIVE
# LOG_FS_TYPE=ext4
